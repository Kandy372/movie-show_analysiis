# movie-show_analysiis

## Phase 1
# Description
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. 
They have hired Flatiron Data Science team to help them better understand the movie industry.
 Our team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. 
We will then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO and stakeholders  can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.
